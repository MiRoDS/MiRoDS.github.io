## Introduction

AirBNB is obviously a great way to make some extra money if you own some unused space in a popular city. However, how can you optimize this since you compete with many other accommendations. What would people select for a stay if there a different options fulfilling their requirements in terms of location, amenities, size and similar features? Yes, the price is probably in important thing. But here it definitly depends on the peoples overall budget for what they are looking. In the end, the review scores rating by other visitors might play an important role.

Is there a way to predict the actual scores rating from the features of an accommendation? If so, could you increase your scores rating by adding a few additional amenities to your accommendation? LetÂ´s take a look into some data to get an answer: In my analysis, I used Boston AirBNB data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/data (file listings.csv) which has been analyzed according to the CRISP-DM process.
